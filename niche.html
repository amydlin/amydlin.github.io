        <h3 class="right">Overview</h3>
        <p class="right">As a Senior Product Designer at Niche, I led design for the Growth and Core Experience teams. I collaborated extensively with my cross-functional partners to lead projects from idea conception to feature launch. My responsibilities often included but were not limited to strategic planning, user research and analysis, and designing for responsive web.</p>

        <h3>Scaling registration</h3>
        <p>As we grow and evolve as a business, the onboarding experience needs to scale and flex with it. While addressing known UX and technical issues, I set up an extremely flexible and adaptable flow meant to highlight features and new offerings. The final designs were less super-specific and more of a template approach that set us up to iterate more efficiently.</p>
        <p>Completion rates increased by 13% after our improvements, and the new foundation sets us up to continue testing and exploring.</p>

        <h3>A new experience for reviews</h3>
        <p>User generated content &#x28;UGC&#x29; is a cornerstone of Niche's offerings, but user contributions had been steadily declining. We introduced a reviews hub to help users see their impact and improve both the breadth and depth of our content. We also connected the experience to give users natural next steps that encouraged more content collection in a lightweight way.</p>
        <p>We increased incoming UGC by over 100% and implemented features like a helpfulness rating, editing capabilities, and an overview analysis.</p>

        <h3>Direct Admissions offers on school profiles</h3>
        <p>In 2024, Direct Admissions really began to pick up steam. Using a student's Niche Profile to see if they qualify, we could offer admission and financial aid to one of our college partners.</p>
