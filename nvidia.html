        <p class="right">I worked on GeForce NOW, a new cloud gaming platform in its beta stage. GeForce NOW bridges NVIDIA's elite hardware performance with an extensive gaming library. I was the first intern in the history of the team staffed to a consumer-facing product.</p>

        <h5>A few highlights and accomplishments</h5>
        <h2>Redesigned the settings page entirely on my own.</h2>
        <img class="narrow" src="assets/images/nvidia/nvidia3.jpg">
        <p>Collaborated with visual designers in the redesign of the card component, which informs everything else (similar to the importance of a content card on Netflix).</p>
        <img class="narrow" src="assets/images/nvidia/nvidia4.png">
        <h2>Led user research to understand user mental models.</h2>
        <p>Due to an understaffed research team and everyone else being uncomfortable with speaking to external users, I wrote the research protocol and led a team of five designers (many being seniors!) in interviews that helped inform our roadmap and architecture.</p>
        <h2>Set up an affinity diagram and led my team through the process of grouping learnings.</h2>
        <img class="narrow" src="assets/images/nvidia/nvidia5.jpg">
        <p>I focused the activity around user goals since it was something I felt had been lacking in conversations.</p>
        <img class="narrow" src="assets/images/nvidia/nvidia6.jpeg">
        <img class="narrow" src="assets/images/nvidia/nvidia6.png">
        <h2>Assisted in retooling the product's architecture to fit users' mental models.</h2>
        <img class="narrow" src="assets/images/nvidia/nvidia7.png">
        <h6>What it looked like before</h6>
        <p>Early research insights clearly showed that the MVP of this product was clunky and dramatically different from users' understanding. I was an active member of the team and collaborated with the development and marketing teams to work towards a more usable experience.</p>
        <img class="narrow" src="assets/images/nvidia/nvidia8.jpeg">
        <h6>After, with a focus on users "snacking" to browse.</h6>
        <h2>Helped organize and participated in an intra-team workshop to blend ideas.</h2>
        <img class="narrow" src="assets/images/nvidia/nvidia9.jpg">
        <p>Attendees included engineering and business team members at all levels to educate about design process and prioritize project goals.</p>
        <h2>Bonus~</h2>
        <p>NVIDIA PR did a photoshoot with me, my team, and my affinity diagram that they still use in promotional materials.</p>
