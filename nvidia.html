        <p class="right">I was lucky enough to spend a semester as an intern at NVIDIA, predominantly working on GeForce NOW, a new cloud gaming platform in beta. I was the team's first intern trusted to work on a consumer-facing product.</p> 
        <p class="right">I also assisted with the design system, cross-functional workshops, and user research.</p>
    </div>
    <img class="widest" src="assets/images/nvidia/nvidia11.png">
    <div class="main">
        <p>I contributed designs for the card component, as well as the settings page, focusing on the concept of easier browsing (snacking), and easier access and improved understanding to important controls.</p>
        <h2>Research methods</h2>
        <p>I wrote the research protocol and led a team of five designers in external user interviews to understand user goals and mental models.</p>
        <img class="narrow" src="assets/images/nvidia/nvidia5.jpg">
        <p>I also took the findings and led the design team in an affinity diagram exercise that helped inform opportunities and our roadmap, focusing on user goals.</p>
        <img class="narrow" src="assets/images/nvidia/nvidia9.jpg">
        <p>I also helped coordinate and structure a crossfunctional workshop with other leads and stakeholders to align the work and set priorities.</p>
        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>Using the results, we restructured some of the work around our architecture and our card component.</p>
    </div>
    <img class="widest" src="assets/images/nvidia/nvidia13.png">
    <div class="main">
        <p>We updated the hover states of game cards to reflect differences in ownership, which affected the user's ability to play the game.</p>
        <img class="narrow" src="assets/images/nvidia/nvidia14.png">
        <p>We also created card details based on user expectations and feedback.</p>
        <p>I learned so much about building and shipping products during my time at NVIDIA, and am grateful to have had the chance to work on an exciting project that was still in beta. I can't wait to see what the team continues to come out with!</p>

<!--        <h2>Led user research to understand user mental models.</h2>-->
<!--        <p>Due to an understaffed research team and everyone else being uncomfortable with speaking to external users, I wrote the research protocol and led a team of five designers (many being seniors!) in interviews that helped inform our roadmap and architecture.</p>-->
<!--        <h2>Set up an affinity diagram and led my team through the process of grouping learnings.</h2>-->
<!--        <img class="narrow" src="assets/images/nvidia/nvidia5.jpg">-->
<!--        <p>I focused the activity around user goals since it was something I felt had been lacking in conversations.</p>-->
<!--        <img class="narrow" src="assets/images/nvidia/nvidia6.jpeg">-->
<!--        <img class="narrow" src="assets/images/nvidia/nvidia6.png">-->
<!--        <h2>Assisted in retooling the product's architecture to fit users' mental models.</h2>-->
<!--        <img class="narrow" src="assets/images/nvidia/nvidia7.png">-->
<!--        <h6>What it looked like before</h6>-->
<!--        <p>Early research insights clearly showed that the MVP of this product was clunky and dramatically different from users' understanding. I was an active member of the team and collaborated with the development and marketing teams to work towards a more usable experience.</p>-->
<!--        <img class="narrow" src="assets/images/nvidia/nvidia8.jpeg">-->
<!--        <h6>After, with a focus on users "snacking" to browse.</h6>-->
<!--        <h2>Helped organize and participated in an intra-team workshop to blend ideas.</h2>-->
<!--        <img class="narrow" src="assets/images/nvidia/nvidia9.jpg">-->
<!--        <p>Attendees included engineering and business team members at all levels to educate about design process and prioritize project goals.</p>-->
        <h2>Bonus</h2>
        <p>NVIDIA PR stumbled upon my affinity diagram in the office and did a photoshoot with my team and I that they still use in promotional materials. I'm second from the right!</p>
